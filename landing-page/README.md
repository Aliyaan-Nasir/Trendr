# Trendr landing page

Marketing site for Trendr, built with Next.js, GSAP, Framer Motion and Lenis.
Its "Launch App" buttons open the trading app, and its Mainnet waitlist form (hero modal and the section before the footer) posts to the backend.
The site is served at trendr.bid, with legal pages at `/terms`, `/privacy` and `/cookies`; the operator details they show live in `src/config/legal.js`.
Third-party images and partner logos, with their sources and licences, are listed in `ASSETS.md`.

## Setup

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
```

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: URL of the trading app (default `http://localhost:3000`, the frontend dev server; production `https://app.trendr.bid`).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: public origin of this site for canonical and Open Graph URLs (default `https://trendr.bid`).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`: the Trendr backend the Mainnet waitlist form posts to (default `http://localhost:4000`; production `https://api.trendr.bid`).
  The backend's `LANDING_URL` must list this site's origin.

## Commands

The frontend also defaults to port 3000, so run the landing page on another port:

```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3002   # http://localhost:3002
npm run build
npm run start -- -p 3002
npm run lint
```
