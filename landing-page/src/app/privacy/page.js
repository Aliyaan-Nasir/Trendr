          <li>when you joined (and when you last joined again), and whether you joined on the website or in the app;</li>
          <li>that you agreed to the launch email, and whether you were invited or unsubscribed;</li>

            a keyed hash of the network address you joined from, used only to stop abuse of the form. The address

          <strong>Purpose.</strong> To email you when Trendr launches on Monad Mainnet and to invite you to its beta.
          We send nothing before then, we do not add you to other lists, and we never sell or share your email for
          marketing.

          any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Retention.</strong> Until the Mainnet launch and its beta invitations are done, and at most 12 months
          after the launch. We delete your entry sooner if you unsubscribe or ask us to.
