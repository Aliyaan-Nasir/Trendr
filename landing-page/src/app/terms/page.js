          Trendr turns social attention into markets. A radar built on Elfa, Bluesky, CoinGecko, GeckoTerminal,
          Wikipedia, Nansen and an AI review proposes trends. A Chainlink CRE oracle records an attention index from 0 to 100 for each trend on the
          Monad blockchain. Accounts can then trade:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Up/Down outcome series on Kuru, settled in AUSD;</li>
          <li>attention perps on a trend&apos;s index;</li>
          <li>trend coins on bonding curves;</li>
          <li>Perpl perps on the asset behind a trend.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Trendr also offers Autopilot rules, copy-trading, a social feed, notifications, leaderboards and a
          portfolio built from public chain data indexed with Envio.

          A Trendr account is a smart account on Monad controlled by a passkey on your device (built with Mera
          and EIP-7702). Trendr is non-custodial:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your passkey never leaves your device or your password manager. We never see or hold it.</li>
          <li>We do not hold your assets and cannot move them without a signature from your account.</li>
          <li>
            We cannot recover a lost passkey, reverse a transaction or restore an account. Keep your passkey safe
            and backed up through your device or password manager.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trading session keys and Autopilot grants act only within the permissions you approve, until they

            The attention index is computed from third-party data (social mentions on X, Telegram and Bluesky,
            news coverage, Wikipedia pageviews, Hacker News mentions and onchain flows), on trends an AI review
