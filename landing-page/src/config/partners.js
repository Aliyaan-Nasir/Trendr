// Tiles on the Signal card: where the attention index comes from and where it is recorded.
// Logo files live in public/assets/logos; their sources and the brand terms that cover them are
// listed in ASSETS.md. A tile with `cover` fills with that picture instead of a centred logo, and a
// tile with `marks` stacks several partners' marks (each with its own size, link or text badge).
// Wikimedia allows its logos only as a link to a Wikimedia site, hence `href` on the Wikipedia tile;
// CoinGecko's attribution guide asks for its logos to link to its sites, hence theirs.
