/**
 * Copy-trading. A leader's Perpl positions are snapshotted per market; each change (open,
 * increase, decrease, close, flip) becomes an order for every follower, sized by the follower's
 * own settings and capped by them. Diffing positions mirrors manual trades and Autopilot trades
 * alike, and a missed snapshot never double-counts: the next diff starts from what the follower
 * holds.
 *
 * A leader can see when and at what limit followers trade, so a copied opening never pays more
 * than the follower's slippage from both the leader's own fill and the mark, and is skipped once
 * the market has moved further. Open losses count against the daily loss limit, and a follow whose
 * open copies lose its loss cap is closed out and paused.
